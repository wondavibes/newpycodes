alternative approach to students.py :> this method doesn't use the DictReader, opens file and calls sorted() on it.
with open("students.csv") as file:
    for line in sorted(file):
        name, house = line.rstrip().split(",")
        print(f"{name} is in {house}")    




def main():
    b = int(input("enter a base-:"))
    p = int(input("enter an exponent-:"))
    print(f"{b} raised to the power of {p} is",expon(b,p))

def expon(x,y):
    return(x**y)

main()
